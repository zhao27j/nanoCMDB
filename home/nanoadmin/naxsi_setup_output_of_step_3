3. Run the Configure Script with Correct Arguments
# Now, run the ./configure script with the parsed arguments and add the Naxsi module:
# "$@" ensures that all arguments are passed exactly as parsed.
# The --add-dynamic-module=../naxsi/naxsi_src/ flag adds the Naxsi module to the configuration.

:~/nginx-1.24.0$ ./configure "$@" --add-dynamic-module=../naxsi/naxsi_src/
